# python-d2-macrosAutocast
Diablo 2 (2000) and LOD (2001) do not support Autocast of abilites like D2R. This script adds the functionality.

## Usage
* Start script as ADMIN so that it works while full screen application is running
* F12: Cancels script execution
* F10: Toggle script on/off (if you are not in the game and the script is running it will be very annoying to try to type sth in the browser)
