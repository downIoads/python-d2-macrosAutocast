# python-d2-macrosAutocast
Diablo 2 (2000) and LOD (2001) do not support Autocast of abilites like D2R. This script adds the functionality.

## Usage
* Start script as ADMIN so that it works while full screen application is running
* F12: Cancels script execution
* F10: Toggle script on/off (if you are not in the game and the script is running it will be very annoying to try to type sth in the browser)

## What problem does this solve?
* After binding abilities to keys these old Diablo games will swap to the ability when you click the key, but not cast the ability meaning you then have to also right-click the mouse. This script does the right-clicking for you.
* In D2R this functionality is already built-in, in PD2 it also seems but be built-in but when I tried it it did not work for me..
